# sephora-nlp
I am currently working on professional projects that showcase the skills I have picked up during my time at UC Berkeley. 

My current project uses a Sephora product dataset with a focus on skincare. I hope to use very common NLP techniques like aspect based sentinment analysis, tf-idf, LDA, etc. to 
find patterns between customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction and recommend products.
